# CoPara ðŸ¥¥ : The First Dravidian Paragraph-level n-way Aligned Corpus

This repository presents CoPara, the first publicly available paragraph-level (n-way aligned) multilingual parallel corpora for Dravidian languages. The collection contains 2856 paragraph/passage pairs between English and four Dravidian languages. We source the parallel paragraphs from the New India Samachar magazine and align them with English as a pivot language. We do human and artificial evaluations to validate the high-quality alignment and richness of the parallel paragraphs of a range of lengths. We hope to help advance research in Dravidian NLP, parallel multilingual, and beyond sentence-level tasks like NMT, etc.
